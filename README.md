# Coastal Concepts website

This website is a statically-genererated site that compiles some Pug templates into HTML.

## Installation

This assumes you have node and npm installed.

To install the packages:

```
npm install
```

To build the development version of the website:

```
npm run dev
```

To serve these files using a local server:

```
npm run server
```

At this point the site will be available to view at http://localhost:8999

To build the production version of the site with minified assets:

```
npm run build
```

At this point all the files in the `build` folder can be uploaded to the hosting server to be served.
